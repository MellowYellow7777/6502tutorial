Memory

The 6502 has a 16-bit wide addressing range. Those 16 address pins are what you would connect your RAMs, ROMs, and IO devices to. To start off, we will just say we have 1 65kb RAM connected to all 16 pins. 

There are a couple pre-designated locations/ranges in RAM:

$0000-$00ff - Zero Page
$0100-$01ff - Stack
$0200-$fff9 - Free Fange Memory
$fffa-$fffb - IRQ Vector
$fffc-$fffd - Reset Vector
$fffe-$ffff - NMI Vector

Zero Page - The 6502 has dedicated instructions that operate faster and use fewer bytes when accessing here. 

Stack - Data is written to and read from this area by combining a $01 high byte with the SP as the low byte, where the SP automatically decrements/increments as data is pushed/pulled.

Interrupt Vectors - These hold 16-bit jump locations where the processor jumps to when the corresponding interrupt is sent.
