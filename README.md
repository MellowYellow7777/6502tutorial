# 6502tutorial

How to write a 6502 emulator.

6502tutorial.txt is the main, full file.

6502tutorial.md is a wip markdown writeup of the same text with hopefully nicer formatting.

/notes are my own notes, which you can also use follow along with.

see /notes/notes(desc).txt for an overview as well as several links to external resources and examples.
